Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of deep learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing a grayscale handwritten digit from 0 to 9. The goal is to train a CNN model that can accurately classify the digits.

This GitHub repository provides a complete implementation of a CNN model using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It serves as a starting point for understanding CNN architectures, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Getting Started
To get started with the MNIST CNN project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/mahachanakya07/mnist-cnn.git.
Install Dependencies: Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies. You can find the list of dependencies in the requirements.txt file. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install them.
Dataset: The repository already includes the preprocessed MNIST dataset in the data directory. You can skip the preprocessing step and directly use the dataset for training and evaluation. However, if you want to preprocess the dataset from scratch, you can refer to the documentation in the data directory for guidance.
Model Configuration: Explore the config.py file to modify the model hyperparameters, such as the number of convolutional layers, filters, and fully connected layers. Adjust these parameters based on your experimentation and hardware capabilities.
Training: Run the training script (train.py) to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The script will save the trained model weights to the saved_models directory.
Evaluation: Use the evaluation script (evaluate.py) to test the trained model on the test set and calculate the accuracy. This script will load the saved model weights and print the evaluation results.
